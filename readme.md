# Smart Home Projects
This collection of projects aim to minimize costs and vendor lock in associated with building a smart based home. Some projects are alternatives to existing products, often with added redundancy or improved features, such as local or manual control. This ensures control over devices when either electricity, network or third parties fail and renders your home more useless than traditional homes.


### What is supported?
Everything evolves around Home Assistant with the powerful ESPHome firmware powering each device. Both Home Assistant and ESPHome aims for a high quality codebase and guarantees high reliability and stability.
However, as all projects are based on Espressifs ESP chips, any compatible firmware, such as Tasmota or even custom Arduino code, can be used. This also opens the possibility to use the devices with other smart home projects or standalone.

### Base configurations
To maximize efficiency is every ESPHome configuration importing a set of common sensors and utilities through the [*packages*](https://esphome.io/guides/configuration-types.html#packages) integration. Base configurations can be found [here](./utilities/firmware-commons).


### Parts
Some custom parts used in the projects can be found [here](./parts.md).
